# FullStackForge
A sample full-stack project built with React, Node.js, TypeScript, Storybook, and Jest.


## Overview
FullStackForge serves as a reference for setting up a full-stack project using modern web development technologies. It demonstrates a practical approach to building maintainable and scalable applications.

## Tech Stack
Here’s an overview of the key technologies used and why they were chosen:

- **Frontend:** 
  - **React**: Chosen for its ability to create dynamic and responsive user interfaces. React's component-based architecture promotes reusability and simplifies the development process.
  - **Storybook**: Employed to build and test UI components in isolation, ensuring that each component is well-documented and behaves as expected across different states.

- **Backend:** 
  - **Node.js**: Selected for its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, which makes it ideal for building fast and scalable server-side applications.
  - **Express**: A minimalist framework for Node.js that simplifies the creation of robust APIs and web applications.

- **Testing:**
  - **Jest**: Integrated as the testing framework to ensure code quality through comprehensive unit and integration tests, enabling confidence in the application’s stability and performance.

- **TypeScript**: Used across both the frontend and backend for type safety, enhancing code reliability and maintainability by catching potential errors at compile time.
